    <h3 id="about">About me:</h3>
    <font size="5">
        <p>
            I’m a passionate and curious individual with a strong interest in technology and creativity.
            <br>
            From a young age, I’ve loved exploring how things work and solving problems, which naturally led me to dive into the world of web development.
            <br>
            I enjoy building websites and applications that are not only functional but also visually appealing and user-friendly.
            <br>
            Besides coding, I’m always eager to learn new skills and stay updated with the latest trends in tech.
            <br>
            I believe continuous learning is the key to growth, both personally and professionally.
            <br>
            When I’m not in front of a screen, I enjoy reading books, exploring nature, and engaging in creative hobbies like photography and writing.
            <br>
            I’m a strong believer in collaboration and communication, knowing that great things happen when diverse ideas come together.
            <br>
            My goal is to contribute positively to projects and communities by bringing enthusiasm, dedication, and fresh ideas.
            <br>
            I’m excited about the opportunities ahead and look forward to connecting with like-minded individuals. 
            <br>
            Whether it’s working on innovative tech solutions or sharing knowledge, I’m ready to take on new challenges and keep growing every day.
            <br>
            In addition to my passion for technology, I’m deeply interested in understanding how people interact with digital products.
            <br>
            This curiosity drives me to focus on user experience and design, ensuring that whatever I create is intuitive and accessible.
            <br>
            I believe technology should simplify life, not complicate it.
            <br>
            Over the years, I’ve worked on a variety of projects—from personal websites to collaborative team efforts—which have helped me develop strong problem-solving skills and adaptability.
            <br>
            I enjoy challenges that push me to think creatively and find effective solutions. 
            <br>
            Each project is an opportunity to learn something new and improve my craft.
            <br>
            Outside of work and study, I’m an advocate for balance and wellness.
            <br>
            Maintaining a healthy lifestyle through exercise, mindfulness, and spending time with friends and family helps me stay motivated and inspired.
            <br>
            I find that a well-rounded life fuels creativity and productivity.
            <br>
            Looking ahead, I’m excited to explore emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence, blockchain, and virtual reality.
            <br>
            I believe these fields hold incredible potential to reshape the future, and I want to be part of that journey.
            <br>
            I’m eager to contribute my skills and enthusiasm to meaningful projects that make a difference.
            <br>
            Thank you for taking the time to learn more about me—I’m always open to connecting and collaborating!
